<h1>SATURN</h1>
<p>Gaseous Saturn is the second largest planet in the solar
system, behind Jupiter. Despite their imposing
appearance, the glorious rings around Saturn are only
about 10m thick! The rings consist of billions of
individual particles of mostly water ice. Interactions
with the gravitational field of Saturn’s moons create
waves, wakes, and other structures. Tiny moons orbit
within gaps in the rings, keeping the gaps open.
Scientists still are not sure exactly how old the rings are
nor how they were formed. But it is clear that the rings
we observe today were not all created in the same way.
NASA’s Cassini mission discovered that a great plume of icy material emanating from
Saturn’s moon Enceladus is a major source of material for the expansive E ring. Cassini
has also discovered new ringlets, a moon that is stealing particles from the narrow F ring,
and features within the rings shaped like straw and rope.

<p>The artist's conception on the left
shows a nearly invisible ring
around Saturn - the largest of the
giant planet's many rings. The new
ring was discovered by NASA's
Spitzer Space Telescope in 2009.

Saturn, though far from the Sun, is still
subject to the Sun’s storms. This false-color
composite image, constructed from data
obtained by NASA's Cassini spacecraft,
shows the glow of aurorae streaking out
about 1,000km from the cloud tops of
Saturn's south polar region. Shown in green,
the aurorae occur when energetic, charged
particles from the Sun, carried by the solar
wind, interact with Saturn’s magnetic field.
The dark spots and banded features are
clouds and small storms that outline Saturn’s
deeper weather systems and circulation
patterns.

Saturn’s stunning ring system glows with scattered sunlight in this image captured by
NASA’s Cassini spacecraft as it passed behind the planet in 2006. This image also shows
Earth—it is the just-barely-visible white dot at the ten o'clock position between the bright
main rings and the thinner, light brown ring.
