<h1>JUPITOR</h1>
<p>Jupiter, the most massive planet in our solar system—with 79 known moons and an
enormous magnetic field (magnetosphere) — forms a kind of miniature solar system.
Gaseous Jupiter resembles a star in composition, but it never grew massive enough to
start the fusion process. Several of its moons are of interest to astrobiologists searching
for life elsewhere in the solar system.
The image above left shows Jupiter’s true colors. The right image has been color-coded
to show cloud height from high altitude (white) through mid-range (blue) to low altitude
(red).

Jupiter’s Great Red Spot, a vast cyclone located
in Jupiter’s southern hemisphere, is about three
times the diameter of Earth and is visible even
through small backyard telescopes. The colors
change as different chemicals and gases are
churned up from the bottom layers to the
“surface” of the gaseous planet. The winds at the
edge of the spot can reach up to 550km per hour.
This long-lasting storm was probably first
observed by astronomer Giovanni Cassini in the
late 1600s. It was not seen up close until NASA’s
Pioneer 10 spacecraft made its flyby in 1974

<p>Everything visible in this image is a
cloud. Unlike on Earth where only
water condenses to form clouds,
Jupiter's clouds are made of
ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, and
water. Jupiter's many jet streams
shear clouds apart, forming
characteristic streaks. The fastest jet
stream winds blow eastward at
480km per hour. The most energetic
features are the small, bright clouds
to the left of the Great Red Spot—
they grow and disappear over a few
days and even generate lightning.
The striking colors in this image of Image Credit: NASA/JPL/Space Science Institute
Jupiter, taken by NASA’s Cassini spacecraft in 2000, are very close to the way the
human eye would see them.
