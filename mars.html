<h1>MARS</h1>
<p>Mars has been the subject of intense study
for centuries. Its exploration has been
wrought with success and failure, and has
witnessed a dramatic evolution in
knowledge. Speculations about the famous
“irrigation canals” on Mars in the late
1800s were finally put to rest by images
returned from NASA’s Mariner 4 mission
in 1965. Revealing icy deserts, impact
craters and a barren landscape, they
dispelled thoughts of thriving, agricultural
civilizations. In the 1970s NASA’s Viking
mission carried out life-detection
experiments on the surface. The results,
suggesting a lifeless planet, raised more
questions than answers.
The next two decades were met with struggle as several spacecraft from the US, Japan,
Europe, and former USSR were lost. Success resurfaced in the late 1990s with the ESA
orbiter Mars Express and NASA’s Pathfinder rover, and Global Surveyor and Odyssey
orbiters—heralding the mantra “Follow the Water.” In 2004, NASA’s twin rovers Spirit
and Opportunity began work. NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and Phoenix lander
followed. As data from these robotic explorers piled up, so did evidence that Mars
preserves a record of surface liquid water and possibly once-habitable environments.

<p>NASA’s Mars Science Laboratory, which arrived in 2012, carried an unprecedented suite
of instruments that can bring us one step closer to determining if life ever started on
Mars. Its Curiosity rover is now offering a human-like perspective to martian landscapes.
ESA's Mars Express obtained this view
of an unnamed impact crater located on
Vastitas Borealis, a broad plain that
covers much of Mars's far northern
latitudes. The circular patch of bright
material is residual water ice. The
colors are very close to natural, but the
vertical relief has been exaggerated
three times. This patch of ice is present
all year, remaining after frozen carbon
dioxide overlaying it disappears during
the martian summer
