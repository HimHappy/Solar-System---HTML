<h1>SUN</h1>
<p>The Sun is our very own star, at the center of our solar system. The Sun is scientifically
designated as a yellow dwarf (because of its place on the HR diagram1
). However, our Sun
is neither yellow nor a dwarf. The Sun appears white to the human eye -- it only looks
yellow or orange when its rays are being scattered by Earth’s atmosphere during sunrise
and sunset. And it is now thought to be brighter and larger than about 85% of the stars in
the Milky Way galaxy, most of which are red dwarfs (stars with low mass that shine in a
relatively cool red).
The Sun consists of hot plasma (a state of matter where electrons have been stripped from
their atoms) interwoven with magnetic fields. It has a diameter about 109 times that of
of Earth, and a million Earths could fit inside it! Its mass accounts for about 99.86% of the
total mass of the solar system. About three-quarters of the Sun consists of hydrogen; the
rest is mostly helium. Less than 2% consists of heavier elements, including oxygen,
carbon, gold, iron, and others. Many of these elements were originally forged in supernova
explosions. So we, and everything in our solar system, are made of “star stuff”2
.

<p>Every second, the Sun fuses 614 million metric tons of hydrogen into 609 metric tons of
helium in its core. The difference is converted into gamma rays that eventually getradiated at the solar surface as lower-energy
photons, primarily visible light. The Sun's
hot atmosphere, called the corona, continuously
expands in space creating the solar wind, a stream of
charged particles that extends beyond the solar
system. The bubble in the interstellar
medium formed by the solar wind, called
the heliosphere, is the largest continuous structure in
the solar system.
