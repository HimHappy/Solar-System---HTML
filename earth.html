<h1>Earth</h1>
<p>Home. These beautiful images are each composites of six separate orbits taken on Jan.
23, 2012 by the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership satellite. Compiled by NASA
Goddard scientist Norman Kuring, the images have the perspective of a viewer looking
down from 12,742km (7,918 miles) above the Earth's surface.
In December of 1968, the Apollo 8 crew flew from the Earth to the Moon and back again.
Frank Borman, James Lovell, and William Anders were launched atop a Saturn V rocket,
circled the Moon ten times in their command module, and returned to Earth on December
27. As the Apollo 8 command module rounded the farside of the Moon, the crew could
look toward the lunar horizon and see the Earth appear to rise. The famous picture that
resulted, below left, shows a distant blue Earth above the Moon's limb, and was a
marvelous gift to the world.

<p>For those who have seen them, the Aurora Borealis and Aurora Australis are spectacles to
remember. Aurorae are caused by currents of energetic charged particles in Earth's
magnetosphere flowing through the upper atmosphere. The interaction of the solar wind
with Earth's magnetosphere drives these currents. The more active the Sun, especially
during the peak of its 11-year solar cycle, the more charged particles flow to Earth’s
magnetic poles. These charged particles eventually collide with gas molecules in the
upper atmosphere, causing them to ionize (lose electrons) and emit colored light.
Earth’s thin atmosphere is all that
stands between life on Earth and
the cold, dark void of space. Our
planet's atmosphere has no clearly
defined upper boundary but
gradually thins out into space.
The layers of the atmosphere have
different characteristics, such as
protective ozone in the
stratosphere and weather in the
lowermost layer. The setting Sun
seen through Earth’s atmosphere
is featured in this image, which
was photographed by the crew of
the International Space Station in
2008.
