<h1>MERCURY</h1>
<p>Mercury is extreme. Of all the planets in our
solar system, it is the smallest, it has the
oldest surface, it is closest to the Sun, it has
the largest daily variations in surface
temperature, and, until recently it was the
least explored. NASA’s Mercury Surface,
Space Environment, Geochemistry, and
Ranging (MESSENGER) spacecraft, which
inserted into Mercury orbit in March 2011
has changed all that! It has revealed rocky
Mercury’s geologic history, the nature of its
weak magnetic field, the structure of its
core, and the composition of its thin
exosphere. MESSENGER has even found
hints of water at Mercury’s dark poles.

<p> What is the source of the radiating streaks in the image on the left? It is the impact crater
Hokusai, seen at the top of the frame, named for Japanese artist Katsushika Hokusai. Its
impressive ray system extends for as far as 1000km. Such rays are formed when an impact
excavates material from beneath the surface and explodes it outward from the crater. Rays
such as these fade over time as they are exposed to the harsh space environment. Hence,
craters with bright rays are thought to be relatively young.
Above right: At a diameter of 100km, the crater Atget is one of the largest craters within the
Caloris Basin (see next image).

The image on the left features the sprawling
Caloris basin, one of the solar system's
largest impact basins. Created during the
early history of the solar system by the
impact of a large asteroid-sized body, the
basin spans about 1500 kilometers and is
seen in yellowish hues in this enhanced
color mosaic. The image data is from the
January 14th flyby of the MESSENGER
spacecraft. Orange splotches around the
basin's perimeter are now thought to be
volcanic vents, new evidence that Mercury's
smooth plains are indeed lava flows.
Scientists often add false color to images to
help them see finer detail. Note how much
easier it is to study this image rather than
the ones on the previous page.
The image below shows the transit
(crossing) of Mercury in front of the Sun’s
disk on 8 November 2006. (Mercury is
about 57 million km away from the sun
