<h1> VENUS</h1>
<p>Venus, second planet from the Sun, has roughly the same size, mass, density, and
composition as Earth. Until the 1960s, scientists and science fiction writers speculated that
Venus might be very Earth-like, and home to lush, tropical forests. That view changed when
new observations confirmed a superheated surface with temperatures over 400C and
atmospheric pressures nearly a hundred times that of Earth. But the biggest difference from
Earth lies within Venus’s atmosphere. The clouds on Venus, which hide its surface, are
made not of water like they are on Earth, but rather of concentrated sulfuric acid—
essentially battery acid. About 700 million years ago, just before life was diversifying on
Earth, Venus experienced tremendous volcanic activity, flooding the surface with new lava
and filling the atmosphere with greenhouse gases, causing a runaway greenhouse effect.
Volcanoes continue to erupt on Venus.
Only radar can probe through the thick clouds in the Venusian atmosphere to make
observations of the surface. Radar data collected over many years from multiple sources
were used to create the beautiful, color-coded portrait of Venus’s surface, above right.
This striking image, right, is
a composite of the complete
radar image collection of
Venus’s surface, obtained
by NASA’s Magellan
mission. The image uses
simulated colors based on
actual color images recorded
by the Soviet Venera 13 and
14 spacecraft.</P>

The Magellan spacecraft was launched aboard Space Shuttle Atlantis in May 1989 and 
Our Solar System
14
began mapping the surface of Venus in September 1990. Magellan spacecraft operations
ended on October 12, 1994, when radio contact was lost with the spacecraft during its
controlled descent into the deeper portions of the Venusian atmosphere
